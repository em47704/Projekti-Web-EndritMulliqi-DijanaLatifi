        If you're studio is tight on space then this cool floating wall desk(opens in new tab) by designer Dario Antonioni may be just the thing for you.
     <br>
            Clever use of geometry and physics eliminates the need for legs, with the design able to accommodate both standing or traditional sitting height. 
           <br> The desk also features a full surface slide out tray and wire management </div>

            This elegant and unusual chair is reminiscent of the chair and desk combinations found in high schools once upon a time.
            <br>
            Designed by Kamilla Lang, the Cafe chair is a modern interpretation of the old school piece, featuring a single  piece of curved wood serving as leg, back, <br> and an armrest that serves as a surface for small items - a perfect resting spot for that well earned cup of coffee.

          We just love these animal coffee and dining tables by international designer Mark Stoddart(opens in new tab).

Each bronze sculpture has been transformed into a table, with the glass table top acting  as water from which the animals emerge.   Stoddart has 99 hand-made sculptures in total,  mainly of animals but there is also a Titanic-inspired piece and another of a small girl collecting pebbles.

            We couldn't do a list of inspirational furniture design without featuring the Panton chair. First introduced to the public in 1967, the piece was created by Verner Panton - known as one of the most influential designers of the 1960s and 70s.

Rcognised as a classic of modern furniture design, the Panton chair was one of the first models to belong to the Museum of Modern Art in New York.

            How cool is this coat rack? Designed by Patrick Seha for Belgian furniture and accessory manufacturer Feld(opens in new tab), the piano hanger is a briliant piece of design. Not only does it look good, it's also incredibly user-friendly.

To hang your coat, you simply unfold hooks as you need them and then flatten them when they're not in use. The many different levels also make it completely child-friendly too!
